# **Rollcap**

**Turn Screenshots into Video-Like Animations with Precision and Clarity**

---

## **About the Project**
**Static screenshots lack context, and screen recordings are too large or capture unnecessary details.**  
Rollcap solves this problem by combining the simplicity of screenshots with the clarity of animations. Capture your process, add context with annotations and share lightweight, easy-to-understand animations.
